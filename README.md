# Week 2 Challenge: Portfolio Project
## Description
This Challenge was a great opportunity to practice the new techniques we have learned in class during the Advanced CSS module. 

Using flexbox, peudo-classes, media queries, and other techniques, I was able to create a portfolio page that is responsive to a mobile device layout.
